# Bootstrap 4

Installation

> > Speaker Notes:
> > This version of bootstrap has a lot of different installation options. Let's take a quick look at the different options available. As of this recording, I'm working with Alpha 6 which might be a bit different than what you're working with, but let's take a look.

## Installation Options

- CSS and JS
- Bootstrap CDN
- Source files
- Package managers

> > Speaker Notes:

1. You can install Bootstrap in one of four ways. The first is to simply download the pre-compiled Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files. That works well if you need to install a copy of bootstrap that will work even without an internet connection.

1. Another way is to use CDNs. A CDN is a content delivery network, which means a place that hosts common libraries like Bootstrap. When someone visits a site that uses a CDN link, their browser will check it's cache or memory to see if the visitor has been to a similar site that's also using the same link. If that's the case, then the browser will load the cached version of the library. Since it's already stored in memory, that makes the new site load faster since the browser won't have to request the file.

1. You can also download the source files. This way, you download not just the css and javascript but all of the files that the developers used to create bootstrap, which includes everything including the original sass files and the documentation. You probably only want to do this if you want to contribute to the project or customize bootstrap. We wont be talking about this option in this course.

1.The last way is to use a package manager. That means using something like NPM, Bower, Composer or NuGet. These are advanced installations that make it easier to work with package managers that help you work with more complex projects.

To get instructions and to download a copy of bootstrap manually, you can go to this URL http://getbootstrap.com
