> > Speaker Notes:

- Let's get started creating the minimum template required to work with Bootstrap. In the last video, I showed you the different options for installing bootstrap. We're going to use the option where we download the files that we need locally.

- In addition to downloading bootstrap, you need to get two additional libraries to make things work properly. Bootstrap requires that you install a copy of jQuery. jQuery is a library that makes it easier and more consistent to work with JavaScript. You can get a copy of jQuery at this URL.

- In order for certain components to work properly, you're going to need to download and install a copy of a library called popper. You can get more information about and download that library at this URL.

- As I mentioned, I already downloaded all of the files for you and placed them in the exercises for this course.
