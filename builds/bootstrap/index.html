  <h2>Testimonials</h2>

  <p>When Samantha, our Siamese cat, began sleeping all the time and urinating excessively, we brought her to see the specialists at Wisdom. Now, two years later, Samantha is still free from any complications of diabetes, and her blood sugar regularly tests normal.</p>
  <p>The staff at Wisdom worked tirelessly to determine why our three-year old Golden Retriever, Roxie, started going into sudden kidney failure. They stabilized her and provided fluids until her kidneys were again functioning normally.</p>
